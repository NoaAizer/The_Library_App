# The library app

Our app comes to meet the need to keep up to date and connect the library with the digital world we live in today.

With the app, people will be able to get the details of the books in the library database, see what the currently recommended books are, place an order and more.

In addition, in order to maintain the user experience, there is a librarian user whose job is to add books to the list of books, update the books in stock, keep track of orders and more.
